/*
Observe that the gaussian algorithm is recursive: When the first leading 1 has been obtained, the
procedure is repeated on the remaining rows of the matrix. This makes the algorithm easy to use on a
computer. Note that the solution to Example 1.1.3 did not use the gaussian algorithm as written because
the first leading 1 was not created by dividing row 1 by 3. The reason for this is that it avoids fractions.
However, the general pattern is clear: Create the leading 1s from left to right, using each of them in turn
to create zeros below it. Here are two more examples.
